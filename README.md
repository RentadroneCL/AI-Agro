# Precision Agriculture

Model Precision_Agriculture
## SUMMARY

Remote sensing has as one of its objectives, to be able to provide useful information in the shortest possible time for decision-making. Therefore, it is considered a fundamental tool in precision agriculture, since it allows the monitoring of crops throughout the growing season, providing timely information as a diagnostic evaluation. This task must identify the factor that operates in a restrictive manner and decide, in a timely manner, on corrective agronomic intervention.
A promising approach to this is one that integrates data derived from temporal, mosaic, multispectral, and thermal imaging. Both processes allow us to obtain products such as: Thermal maps and Normalized vegetation index maps; These products allow us to identify stress zones which serve as support in agricultural management tasks.
That is why our objective is to develop an Open Source platform, distributed on a GitHub platform that is capable of generating diagnostic tools or early warning of water stress, health status (attack by pests or diseases), phenological status, nutritional deficiencies, productivity. and performance, among others; by capturing the variations in the reflectivity of the plants during the different growth stages, through the processing of images taken with UAV.
Key words: Vegetation index, phenological status, agricultural management, Open Source platform.
